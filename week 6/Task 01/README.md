### Day 01
## Task 01 - What is global state?

- Global states are variables or pieces of data that can be accessed and modified by multiple components across an application.
- They are called "global" because they are not confined to a single component but are available throughout the application.

### Managing Global State in React
React provides several ways to manage global state. Here are the most common methods:

- `Context API:` Built-in React feature for sharing state across the component tree.
- `Redux:` A popular library for managing global state with a unidirectional data flow.
- `MobX:` Another state management library that uses observables to reactively manage state.
- `Recoil:` A state management library developed by Facebook, designed to work seamlessly with React.
