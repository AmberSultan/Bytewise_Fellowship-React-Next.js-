## Task 04 - React router intro

### Router:
  The Router component keeps your UI in sync with the URL. There are different types of Routers:
### Route:
  The Route component renders some UI when its path matches the current URL. It can take various props:

- path: The path to match against the current URL.
- component: The component to render when the path matches.
- render: A function that returns a React element, which allows you to pass props to the component.

### Link: 
  - The Link component allows navigation to different routes in your application. 
  - It works like an anchor tag (<a>) but prevents the browser from reloading the page.

## Install React Router:

`npm install react-router-dom`
