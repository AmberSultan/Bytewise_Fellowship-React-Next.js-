### Day 01
## Task 01 - What are npm projects?

- npm (Node Package Manager) projects are software projects that use npm for managing and sharing code.
- npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
- It helps developers to install, share, and manage code libraries and packages for their applications.

## Common Commands:
- `npm install`: Installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`.
- `npm install <package-name>`: Installs a specific package and adds it to `dependencies`.
- `npm install <package-name> --save-dev`: Installs a package and adds it to `devDependencies`.
- `npm run <script-name>`: Runs a script defined in the `scripts` section of `package.json`.
- `npm publish`: Publishes the project as a package to the npm registry.

## Benefits of Using npm:
- **Reusability:** Allows developers to reuse code from a vast library of packages.
- **Collaboration:** Facilitates collaboration by managing dependencies and project configurations.
- **Efficiency:** Automates tasks such as testing, building, and deployment through npm scripts.
