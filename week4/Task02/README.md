# Bytewise_Fellowship (React & Next.js)
## Week 04 (02/07/24)

### Day 02
## Task 02 - What are libraries and frameworks

### Libraries
- collections of pre-written code that developers can use to optimize tasks, implement specific features.
- They offer specific functionalities that can be integrated into your projects.

1. **React Router**: A library used for handling routing in React applications, allowing you to navigate between different components and views.
2. **Redux**: A state management library that helps manage and centralize application state, making it easier to handle complex state logic.
3. **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to servers, often used to fetch data from APIs.
4. **Lodash**: A utility library that provides helpful functions for manipulating arrays, objects, and other data structures.
5. **Moment.js**: A library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates, although its use is decreasing in favor of more modern alternatives like `date-fns` or `Luxon`.

### Frameworks

- provide a more comprehensive solution by offering a structured way to build applications, including built-in tools, conventions, and best practices.

1. **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and other advanced features like API routes, making it easier to build production-ready applications.

### Key Differences

- **Scope**: Libraries are typically focused on specific tasks or problems, while frameworks offer a broader structure and tools for building entire applications.
- **Control**: Using libraries allows developers more control over how they integrate and use the provided functionalities. Frameworks, on the other hand, impose certain conventions and structures, streamlining the development process but also limiting flexibility.
- **Integration**: Libraries are usually easy to integrate into existing projects, while frameworks often require adopting their specific way of doing things from the start.
