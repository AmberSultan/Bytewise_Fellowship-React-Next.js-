## Week 04 (03/07/24)

### Day 03
## Task 03 -  Routing in React, how is it different that vanilla HTML?

## Routing in React

- Routing in React can be efficiently managed using the `react-router-dom` library. 
- This library allows you to create a single-page application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates.

## Difference from vanilla HTML

### 1. Single-Page Application (SPA) vs Multi-Page Application (MPA)

- Vanilla HTML -> MPA
- React -> SPA

### 2. Handling Routes

- Vanilla HTML -> handle by server
- React -> handle by using library `React-Router`

### 3. State Management

- Vanilla HTML -> by JS
- React -> props, states(useState, useEffect..)
